# SNA2 Final Presentation - Github Organizations

## Dataset

Dataset containing top Github organizations and their contributors

## Research Question

What is the connectedness of members within and between Github organizations?

## Hypothesis

As an increasing amount of active and diverse members collaborate and contribute to open-source projects, they are more likely to be connected to larger networks of developers and organizations â€“ increasing their level of connecteness within and between Github organizations.

## Purpose

Using social network analysis, we sought to find collaborations within and between various github organizations. Our code is taking all the members within and between the groups to calculate their connectedness.

The code is meant for social network analysis, graph building and analysis. This code imports the required libraries, mounts Google Drive, imports the data file, creates a bipartite graph, calculates the closeness centrality, finds the cliques, creates a clique bipartite graph, calculates the local bridges, and displays the graphs for analysis and visualization purposes.


To access the dataset we used in our analysis, please refer to the [organization.csv](./dataset.csv) file in this repository.
