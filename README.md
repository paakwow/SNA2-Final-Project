# SNA2 Final Presentation - Github Organizations

## Dataset

Dataset: Dataset containing top Github organizations and their contributors

## Research Question

Research Question: What is the connectedness of members within and between Github organizations?

## Hypothesis

Hypothesis: The more actively and diversely members collaborate and contribute to open-source projects, and the more they are connected to larger networks of developers and organizations, the higher their level of connectedness within and between Github organizations.

## Purpose

Purpose: Using social network analysis, we sought to find collaborations between various github organizations. Our code is taking all the members within and between the groups to calculate their connectedness.

The code is meant for social network analysis, graph building and analysis. This code imports the required libraries, mounts Google Drive, imports the data file, creates a bipartite graph, calculates the closeness centrality, finds the cliques, creates a clique bipartite graph, calculates the local bridges, and displays the graphs for analysis and visualization purposes.


To access the dataset we used in our analysis, please refer to the [organization.csv](./dataset.csv) file in this repository.
